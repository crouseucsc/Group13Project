		<p>When we throw items in the trash, that can otherwise be recycled,
			it usually sent to a landfill. But before that, our trash goes on the magical joruney to a
			dirty material recovery facility. In these dirty MRFs, recyclable items within the trash are hand sorted and seperated.
			These recycable materials are then sent to recycling facilites/composters, while the rest of the
				garbage is sent to a landfill. It should be noted, however, that dirty MRF are not always used, and sometimes the trash is directly sent to a landfill.</p>

				</p>Landfills are massive piles of garbage; layers of clay, plastic, and soil line
				 these piles, which are used to help serpate toxic materials from the enviorment. Eventually the garbage within these landfills will decompose, however, this process
				  takes much, much longer than normal.</p>

				</p>	Landfills aren't the only destination for our trash either, garbage can also find it's way into trash incinerators. Garbage is (as you guessed it) incinerated, which can release
					harmful air polluants.</p>
