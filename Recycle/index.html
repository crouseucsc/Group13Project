		<p>When we throw items in the recycle, it goes to a clean material recovery facility.
			 Clean MRFs process these recycable materials, and seperate them into various categories. These materials
		 are then sent to recycling faicilties/composters, where these materials are reprocessed and reused to create new products.  </p>
